# Reqstool Python Poetry Plugin

## Description

This provides a generic plugin for Poetry that runs during the build process.

The plugin collects decorated code, formatting it and writing it to a annotations.yml file saved to the `build/reqstool/` folder, utilizing the `reqstool-python-decorators` package for the processing.


## Installation

### Plugin

The package name is `reqstool-python-poetry-plugin`.

* Using poetry:

```
$poetry add reqstool-python-poetry-plugin 
```

* pip install (unsure if working as intended):

```
$pip install reqstool-python-poetry-plugin
```

### Dependencies

#### reqstool-decorators

The plugin reads decorators available in the `reqstool-python-decorators` package.

```
$pip install reqstool-python-decorators
```

pyproject.toml

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
reqstool-python-decorators = "<version>"
```

### Configuration

The plugin is configured in the `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
[tool.reqstool]
sources = ["src", "tests"]
test_results = "build/**/junit.xml"
dataset_directory = "docs/reqstool"
output_directory = "build/reqstool"

This specifies where the plugin should be applied: `sources`, where test reports are located: `test_results`, where reqstool files are located: `dataset_directory` and output directory: `output_directory`.


## Usage

```

### Decorators

Used to decorate your code as seen in the examples below, the decorator processing that runs during the build process collects data from the decorated code.

Import decorators:

```
from reqstool-python-decorators.decorators.decorators import Requirements, SVCs
```

Example usage of the decorators:

```
@Requirements("REQ_111", "REQ_222")
def somefunction():
```

```
@SVCs("SVC_111", "SVC_222")
def test_somefunction():
```

### Poetry build

When running `$poetry build` or `$poetry install` the plugin will run the `activate` function located inside `DecoratorsPlugin` class, calling functions from the `reqstool-python-decorators` package and generate a annotations.yml file in the `build/reqstool/` folder containing formatted data on all decorated code found.
